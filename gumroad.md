=======================================================================
BUNKER 2.0: Your Digital Fortress (Terminal Edition) Price: FREE! $0 OR PAY WHAT YOU WANT! 

🚀 BUNKER 2.0: Your Offline, No-BS Digital Vault (.Py Source Code)

(AKA "The Only Password Manager That Doesn’t Sell Your Data to Corporate")

Price: FREE! $0 OR PAY WHAT YOU WANT! (Open Source, But Low-Key Funding My Company's Dream 👀)
👉 "SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY[KickStarter Coming Soon]" | 🔍 "LET ME SEE THAT DEMO FIRST [YouTube]"

🔥 - WHY THIS SLAPS

* Your data NEVER leaves your device (Cloud? Lame. Tracking? Cringe.)
* Military-grade encryption (So secure, even you might forget your password)
* Self-destruct mode → Vault auto-deletes after 3 wrong guesses or if files get tampered. Poof.
* Attempt counter resets on login → Fresh 3 tries every session (no permanent lockouts).
* Zero-setup vaults → First run? Boom, encrypted vault ready in 60 seconds.

💸 REAL TALK: THIS IS A CROWD FUND

Yo, I’m @RICKY—founder of ZeroMarks ( that eco-friendly, privacy-obsessed tech startup )—and I’m building a VPN (dropping in 3 months). Buying BUNKER 2.0 isn’t just about getting a cracked password manager—it’s about fueling:

✅ ZeroMarks VPN - Anonymous browsing that actually respects privacy (no email, no tracking) - $7/month
✅ Green Web Hosting (100% renewable energy, because Earth > profits)
✅ Cybersecurity Consulting (Pen testing for businesses, so they don’t get hacked)
✅ Custom Dev Projects (We build dope, privacy-first tech)
✅ Carbon-Negative Data Centers (Launching 2026—yes, we’re that ambitious)

Think of this as your chance to "invest" in a startup… except you actually get dope software upfront.

🛠️ WHAT’S IN THE BOX?

BUNKER.py (The main script—flex your Python skills)
README.md (Instructions so easy, even your non-techy friend could follow)
Demo password: rootroot (Change this ASAP unless you wanna get hacked)

Features:
✔ Offline storage (No cloud = no leaks)
✔ Encrypted notes & passwords (AES-256, because we’re not amateurs)
✔ IP tracking toggle (Max attempts → vault goes bye-bye. Your choice, saved locally)
✔ Brute-force protection (Patches coming soon—buy now, update free later)

🚨 FUTURE UPDATES (YOU DECIDE! Request A Feature)
Crypto wallet manager (Store your Bitcoin keys safely)
Phone number manager (store phone contacts)
Better brute-force handling (Current workaround: attempts is plaintext—fix coming!)
Mobile and Tablet UI (Detects the device and displays the corresponding UI/UX)

👾 HOW TO INSTALL (IT’S EASY, I PROMISE)

Download Python 3 (python.org)

Run one command:bash

pip install cryptography pyperclip psutil requests && python3 BUNKER.py



You Are Ready.
